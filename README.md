# Training

This is a set of exercises built to help others learn typescript. There are currently 2 topics.

## Clean Code

This is an oppinionated take on how to write clean code. Many of these are common best practices, but also suggest a consistent style of coding to promote readibility and maintainability. I've also found that following these suggestions will lead to fewer coding errors.

Each class under the src folder will show you examples of bad code vs clean code. These are meant to be taught in person with an instructor, but you should still be able to understand what's going on without one.

## Typescript Generics

Generics are easy to get started with but can be dificult to master. The first 2 exercises walk you through the basics of generics while the last 2 explain some of the more advanced concepts you may run into. Each folder under src contains a exercise.ts and solution.ts. Each exercise will provide you instructions on what to code. The solution contains the completed code with additional explanations when appropriate. There is an index.ts file at the root of src that allows you to start and run your code.

## Installing

All exercises that can be run will have an init task and a start task. For example:
* init - typescript-generics
* start typescript-generics
